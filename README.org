* Documentation is Unfinished

I haven't written a README for this library yet. If you would like to learn a 
little about this thing, please read this post on my blog:

* Examples

For some examples that show how this library can be used, please take
a look at =test.ml=. It doesn't really show how to use the =LazyList=
module.

** Version 0.5
   - Updated descriptions for OPAM.
   - Added more information to this README file.
